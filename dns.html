                    <p>DNS is one of the most important processes on the web and it is also one of the most overlooked Domain Name Servers. DNS address one of the fundamental differences between humans and computers. When a web server hosts a website the site is assigned a unique IP address that is used to identify its location. While computers find working with these long strings of numbers very simple, humans struggle to remember them. In order to make the web a little bit more usuable for humans, every website is also assigned a unique domain name that has been associated with the siteâ€™s IP and that is where the DNS comes in.</p>
                    <p>Other have described it as the phone book of the internet. The DNS system is an incredibly complex and fluid datbase that is distributed across servers all over the world. When registering a newly hosted website it is assigned an IP address and then registered with the DNS. Your hosting company usually handles this step, associating the domain name with the IP behind the scenes. Your website is now registered and ready to accept requests. So know what happens when a request is made?Remember the DNS system is a huge database spread all over the world. What happens if you make a request that your local DNS does not recognize? This is where it gets a little bit more complicated, there are a group of servers called root name servers.These name servers in turn, know all the name servers for what we call top level domains. So, in the case of lynda.com, the route name servers would give the location of the .com name server. Now if the address is still not found, in this case, you would get the dreaded DNS error message telling you that your site can not be found at that location and you will need to try again.</p>
                    <p>DNS caching helps tomspeed up the retrieval process even further. If you visited the site within about 24 hours, your default DNS will cache the name for you, and that makes the retrieval really fast. Why does DNS matter to us designers? It matters greatly, if the DNS is not assigned properly when you register your site, no one is gonna be able to find you. It is really important to monitor this process when registering multiple domain names for one site. You need to make sure that the domain names are registered to the correct IP. Most importantly, you need to make sure that ownership of the site is properly registered. If you register in your name, you own that site. Getting the site transferred from one hosting company to another and thereby changing the DNS listing would be impossible without your assistance. Hosting companies will not make changes w/out the owners consent, if you are registering a site for a client, make sure that relationship is clearly understood and the proper owner listed for the site. Most name servers do not refresh their cache for about 24 hours. Which means that if you migrate your site from one host to another, any servers that cached your old location would not point to the new site for about a day or so. That is why migrating sites over the weekend makes the most sense and you will have fewer visitors wondering where everything went.</p>
