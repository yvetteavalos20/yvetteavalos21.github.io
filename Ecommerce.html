                    <p>In the last couple of years, Ecommerce has become a very exciting space. Older Ecommerce platforms were really complex, really expensive or both. The software has finally become affordable enough for anyone to open up their own store. Now a days, you can set up an Ecommerce store in a number of hours and sell just about anything. Because there is so many ways you can build and market your store, it is worth thinking about your business model before you start thinking about the specific software you are going to use. There are not any right answers when it comes to Ecommerce. Everyone is in a different situation and needs to make the best decision for themselves. The first thing you need to do is pick an area of interest. This can be anything you want to look into. It can be a passion of yours, or it can be an industry, like home automation. Once you pick an area of intrest, you want to explore the different ways you can sell products. There are two very broad types of products, physical and virtual: Each of these have several different business models you can explore, the standard Ecommerce model model that we all think of is selling physical goods. If you are interested in selling physical goods, the next step to think of is how you are going to acquire products.</p>
                    <p>One option is to create the goods yourself. If you have a skill, you can create all sorts of products from scratch. Creating the goods yourself is a cheap way to get started, but it is time sensitive. Another option is wholesale/resale. Wholesaling involves buying a large amount of products from a manufacturer and then reselling those products. A pretty popular option that has been getting a lot of attention on blogs and podcasts is drop-shipping. Drop-shipping is where you take orders on your site and send that information to the manufacturer or wholesaler and they send the products to the customer.The down side of drop-shipping and wholesaling is that you will definitely have to do marketing to separate your store from the competition to sell the product. Another option is to manufacture products. You can contact a manufacturer and work with them to create products which you will sell directly to the customer. You can also sell virtual products that don’t take any space.</p>
                    <p>These could be books, software, or membership to a website. Virtual products can take a while to create, but one they are ready to sell, they can be sold over and over again with very little upkeep. If you are a trusted voice in an industry, you can use your reputation to sell products. You have to bring traffic to your site, so people can find your recommendations, but once people are on your site and they start clicking on your affiliate links, you start getting commissions and don’t have to do anything to fulfill the orders or deal with customer support. Affiliate marketing takes time to build income because you need to have compelling content so that people find your site and keep coming back.</p>
