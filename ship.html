                    <p>A big decision when selling physical goods is how to calculate shipping costs. Some stores charge a flat rate of two dollars per item, while others offer free shipping on orders over one hundred dollars, while some are more selective, allowing one type of product to ship for free, while charging a fee for the other items.</p>
                    <p>Some platforms do not have a lot of shipping options. Platforms like Gumroad and Easy Digital Downloads are built for digital products, which are delivered via a download link. If you choose one of these platforms, make sure that you are okay with limited shipping options. One of the most basic shipping options is Flat Rate shipping. With Flat Rate shipping, there is usually a per order or a per item cost. Flat Rate shipping is great bc it is usually very easy to setup and test. Also, this option does not require you to create any accounts with shipping providers, nor have the weight and dimensions for every single one of your products, as some other methods do.</p> 
                    <p>Free shipping is something that many eCommerce platforms have. If you offer free shipping at a certain point, customers will spend a bit more to avoid the shipping charges. You often see this from large retailers, like Amazon.com, and smaller retailers, like ModCLoth. The next type of shipping option that store owners want are estimates.</p>
                    <p>Instead of guessing how much shipping will cost you, and passing those costs along to the customer, you can get rates directly from a shipping provider, like USPS, FedEx or UPS. This way, your shipping costs match exactly how much the user is paying. This is a great idea, but it is hard to setup. You will most likely have to create an account with the shipping company, which are free, but they take some time to set up. To begin, you will need to record the weight and dimensions for every single one of your products, as well as the dimensions for the boxes you are planning on using.</p>
                    <p>Your eCommerce platforms should do the work of figuring out how to pack the items into the provided boxes, and send that information to the shipping provider. As long as you have the dimensions and weights for your products, and you have the time to set up the accounts, they can save you a bunch of time and money calculating your own costs. After this, we start moving into the really complex rates. These different rates could be calculated on the total weight of the order, or the number of products, or the cost of the order, or something else. These types of rates are useful when you have very different types of products, like if you sell furniture and also some clocks. These rates are pretty complex and may take you some time to configure.</p>
